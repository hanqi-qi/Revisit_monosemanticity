$$xdy - ydx = (x^2 + y^2)^{1/2} dx$$

I tried bringing the sq root term to the left and it looked like a trigonometric substitution might do the trick, but apparently no.

Any help would be appreciated.",$$x\frac{dy}{dx} - y = (x^2 + y^2)^{1/2} $$ is an ode of the homogeneous kind,the substitution $y = u x$ makes this into a separable differential equation,-5.383998870849609,-1.9642314910888672,-2.97509765625,-2.8814477920532227
